# RubbishRoutes

## Introduction

<img src="./logo.png" alt="logo" />
RubbishRoutes is a CLI tool designed to streamline the development process by automating the creation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Node.js applications. It offers a quick and easy way to generate boilerplate code for your RESTful APIs, saving time and reducing the potential for errors.

## Features

- Generate CRUD operation files with a single command.
- Supports common REST API endpoints.
- Customizable file generation based on user-defined models and paths.
- Interactive CLI prompts for ease of use.

## Installation

To install RubbishRoutes, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g rubbishroutes
```

This will install RubbishRoutes globally on your system, allowing it to be run from any project directory.

## Usage

RubbishRoutes is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Below are some common use cases:

### Generating a Full CRUD for a Model

To generate all CRUD operations for a model, navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
rubbishroutes generate --model <ModelName> --path <TargetDirectory>
```

Example:

```bash
rubbishroutes generate --model User --path ./src/controllers
```

This command will generate `CreateUser`, `ReadUser`, `UpdateUser`, and `DeleteUser` functions in the specified directory.

### Generating Specific CRUD Operations

You can also generate specific CRUD operations by specifying the type:

```bash
rubbishroutes generate --type <OperationType> --model <ModelName> --path <TargetDirectory>
```

Available operation types: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `list`, `search`.

Example:

```bash
rubbishroutes generate --type create --model Product --path ./src/controllers
```

### Customizing File Paths

RubbishRoutes allows you to specify the target directory for the generated files. Use the `--path` option to define where your CRUD files should be created.

### Interactive Mode

If you run RubbishRoutes without any arguments, it will enter an interactive mode, prompting you for details:

```bash
rubbishroutes
```

## Advanced Configuration

RubbishRoutes supports advanced configurations through a `.rubbishroutesrc` file. This allows you to set default behaviors, templates, and other settings.

Example `.rubbishroutesrc`:

```json
{
  "defaultPath": "./src/controllers",
  "useMongoDB": true
}
```


Certainly! To make the usage of "RubbishRoutes" clearer, especially regarding its flags and how to chain them together, we can expand the `README.md` with more detailed explanations and examples. Hereâ€™s an improved usage section with comprehensive details about each flag and how they can be combined.

## Detailed Usage of RubbishRoutes

RubbishRoutes simplifies the process of generating CRUD operations for Node.js applications through a set of command-line flags. These flags can be combined to customize the generated code to fit your project's structure and requirements.

### Flags Overview

1. **`--model <ModelName>`**: Specifies the name of the model for which CRUD operations are to be generated. The model name is used in the generated files.

2. **`--type <OperationType>`**: Determines the type of CRUD operation to generate. Possible values include `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `list`, and `search`. If this flag is omitted, all CRUD operations will be generated by default.

3. **`--path <TargetDirectory>`**: Defines the directory where the generated files will be placed. The path should be relative to the project's root directory.

### Combining Flags

You can combine these flags to tailor the generation process. Here are some examples of how to use them:

#### Generating All CRUD Operations for a Model

To generate all CRUD operations for a specific model, use the `--model` flag along with the `--path` flag:

```bash
rubbishroutes generate --model User --path ./src/controllers
```

This command generates all CRUD operation files for the `User` model in the `./src/controllers` directory.

#### Generating Specific CRUD Operations

To generate a specific CRUD operation, add the `--type` flag:

```bash
rubbishroutes generate --type create --model Product --path ./src/controllers
```

This command will only generate the `create` operation for the `Product` model.

#### Chaining Multiple Operations

You can run multiple commands in sequence to generate different operations for the same or different models:

```bash
rubbishroutes generate --type create --model Product --path ./src/controllers
rubbishroutes generate --type read --model Product --path ./src/controllers
```

This sequence of commands generates separate `create` and `read` operations for the `Product` model.

### Interactive Mode

If you prefer not to use flags, simply run `rubbishroutes` without any arguments to enter an interactive mode that guides you through the generation process:

```bash
rubbishroutes
```

In this mode, the tool will prompt you for the necessary information, such as the model name, operation type, and target directory.
